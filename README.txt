# Assignment 4 - Number Guessing Game

## Description
This Python application implements a number-guessing game. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The app provides hints (too high/too low) and keeps track of the user's score. The application is Dockerized for easy deployment and portability.
